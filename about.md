<p>Hi! I am <span class="emphasize">Yang Ye</span>. I am currently a final-year Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://www.sdsc.cityu.edu.hk/">School of Data Science</a> at <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/">City University of Hong Kong</a>, under the direction of <a href="http://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/zhang.htm">Prof. Qingpeng Zhang</a>. I received the B.S. degree in logistics management from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2019.</p>

<p>My research interests include complex networks and mathematical epidemiology. I have been working on developing mathematical and computational models on real-world and synthetic networks to 
	(1) investigate infectious disease dynamics, project potential epidemic outcomes, and inform public health policies at different scales, ranging from individuals to nations, and 
	(2) explore the interactions between epidemics, social interactions, and economics. 
My work is a combination of mathematical modelling, agent-based simulations, and equation-based simulations.</p>
